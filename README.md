# My first React demo application

<p align="center"><img src="/src/img/socialboom banner.png"></p>

I introduce socialboom ðŸ’£! This application is my first React experience.
I fell in love with React at first sight because of its simplicity, logic, and declarative approach.

The idea that stands behind this project is very simple. Instead of creating straightforward boring 'todo-lists', I love to enjoy my new projects. Combining coding with design is an incredibly exciting task.

Creating this modern little demo app was the best opportunity for me to enjoy practicing React basics such as components management & communication, data flow via `props`, managing `states`, `CSS modules` or just getting used to `JSX`.

## What is socialboom?

It's a DEMO social application that allows users to share their ideas, experiences and mindset. It's a demo app, so lots of different features are missing. However, implementing features was not the goal of this project as much as practicing React concepts.

I implemented:

- fake sign-up form (data is not processed anywhere) allows a user access profile where input user data is dynamically rendered in DOM
- welcome popup
- user info bar
- new post form and rendering post (date, content, tags, and image)
